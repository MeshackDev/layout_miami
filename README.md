# Miami landing page
In this task, I will be developing a landing page.

I will be using the landing page design from:
- [BOSE landing](https://www.figma.com/file/OMjQNb3hg1LKMV4OwyQ3Ao/BOSE?node-id=0%3A1)

The following steps have been taken to complete the project:
  1. Add a favicon.
  2. Add a title for the whole web page.
  3. All Logos on the page should be links to home page
  4. Change text color on hover for phone, email and address
  5. When you click on phone icon or phone number in contacts section, make sure that there is no 404 error,make it a real link to start a call on device
  6. Same when you click on logo. There shouldn't be any error.
  7. When clicking on any location / address - prevent errors and make it to open location in Google Maps
  8. Pictures in Gallery should increase on hover
  9. Location-related addresses / links should open google maps in a new tab target="_blank"
  10. Apply :hover effect for images on page (testimonials / gallery, other sections).
  11. Make sure everything looks neat on mobile and without horizontal scrolling
  12. The speed of animations is the same throughout the landing page (for example, increasing when hovering or moving blocks when scrolling)
  13. Placeholders in the forms suggest what to enter; apply validation of the form fields (required, email / tel etc.), then it is clear in what format to enter the data
  14. Form shouldn't be submitted if some of the fields are not filled
  15. Page shouldn't be reloaded on form submit (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault)
  16. Add a smooth scroll for the whole page
  17. Fix menu for small screens (if there is not enough space for all the menu items


  The landing page is deployed on the following link:
